# Agent manifest `centralcity.agent/v1`

AI clients (Claude, Codex, ChatGPT) describe what they want as a JSON manifest: one agent (`kind: Agent`) or a whole team (`kind: Team`). The server resolves templates and forks, produces a deterministic dry-run plan, and only then (after approval where required) applies it.

The schema and validator are in [`shared/manifest.ts`](../shared/manifest.ts); the generated JSON Schemas are in [`protocol/schemas/manifest/`](../protocol/schemas/manifest). The MCP tools `city_list_templates`, `city_plan_team`, `city_create_agent` (manifest mode) and `city_apply_team` accept these documents on `https://centralcity.ai/mcp`, and anonymously on `https://centralcity.ai/mcp/open`.

## Agent manifest

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "centralcity.agent/v1",
  "kind": "Agent",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "invoice-reader",
    "displayName": "Invoice reader",
    "description": "Pulls fields out of pasted invoices.",
    "labels": { "team": "finance" }
  },
  "spec": {
    "extends": "template:extractor@1.0.0",
    "instructions": "Prefer ISO dates.",
    "policy": { "maxDepth": 1 },
    "visibility": "private"
  }
}
```

Fields (all objects reject unknown keys):

- `metadata.name` — slug `[a-z0-9-]`, at most 63 characters; the stable identity used for idempotent planning. `displayName` (≤64, defaults to the name), `description` (≤300), `labels` (≤16 slug keys → short values).
- `spec.extends` — `template:<id>@<major.minor.patch>` or `agent:<uuid>@<revision>` (fork).
- `spec.capabilities` — 1–8 unique slugs. The schema is open (extensible), but planning currently requires hosted agents to use only `research`, `extract`, `verify`, and other runtimes to list one of those first (the native store keeps a single capability).
- `spec.runtime` — `mode`: `hosted` | `external` | `a2a`; optional `model {provider: platform|anthropic|openai|byo|external, name?}`; `endpoint` (https, public host) is required for and only allowed with `a2a`. Hosted agents cannot use `external` models; non-hosted agents cannot use `platform`. `a2a` runtimes plan with a `RUNTIME_PENDING` warning because outbound A2A is not executable yet.
- `spec.instructions` — at most 8000 characters.
- `spec.skills` — at most 32, unique `id`; `{id, name, description, tags, inputModes?, outputModes?, examples?}`. Compiled directly into Agent Card skills.
- `spec.tools.mcpServers` — at most 8 `{name, url (https, public host), scopes[]}`, unique names. Declarative only: nothing connects to these servers yet.
- `spec.policy` — `budgetUsd` (0–1000, cents precision, **default 0 = zero-cost only**), `maxChildren` (0–20, default 0: the number of members this agent may connect to), `maxDepth` (0–3, default 3: longest delegation chain below the agent), `allowedDomains` (≤32 lowercase DNS names, optional `*.` prefix; empty = none), `approvalRequiredFor` (subset of `spend`, `paid-model`, `external-network`, `tool-call`, `delegation`, `publication`).
- `spec.visibility` — `private` (default) | `org` | `public`.

### URL and host rules

URLs must be `https:` without credentials or fragments, on a DNS name with at least two labels. IP literals (any form the URL parser normalizes to one, such as `2130706433` or `0x7f.1`), IPv6 literals, `localhost` and reserved or private suffixes (`.local`, `.internal`, `.home.arpa`, `.lan`, `.corp`, `.test`, `.example`, `.invalid`, `.onion`, `nip.io`, `sslip.io`, `localtest.me`, …) are rejected. These are static checks. Any future code that fetches these URLs must still resolve DNS and refuse private or loopback addresses at connection time (DNS rebinding).

### Limits

The JSON document may be at most **32 KiB** (UTF-8), checked before schema parsing; the resolved manifest is held to the same bound. Teams have at most 20 members and 100 connections; agents at most 32 skills.

## Resolution

The input is parsed, the base (template or forked agent revision) loaded, and the document merged:

- objects merge key by key; **arrays replace**; scalars override; absent keys inherit;
- `metadata.name` always comes from the child, `displayName` falls back to the base, then the name;
- `spec.runtime` is replaced wholesale when the child names a different `mode`;
- the child's `spec.extends` is kept in the resolved document as provenance.

The merged document must satisfy the full schema (required capabilities and runtime, cross-field runtime rules, defaults applied). Errors are reported as `issues: {code, path, message, hint}[]`.

**Forks.** The server loads and authorizes the forked revision. A same-owner fork overrides freely. Forking another owner's agent requires `org` or `public` visibility (`FORK_NOT_PERMITTED` otherwise) and may only **tighten**: `budgetUsd`, `maxChildren` and `maxDepth` cannot grow; `allowedDomains` must be covered by the parent's (a `*.x` parent covers subdomains, not the apex); `approvalRequiredFor` cannot drop actions; MCP servers cannot be added (matched by URL). Violations are `POLICY_LOOSENED` / `TOOLS_EXPANDED`.

**Hash.** `manifestHash = "sha256:" + hex(SHA-256(JCS(resolved)))`. Key order, omitted defaults versus explicit defaults and whitespace do not change it. Template versions are immutable, so a `template:` reference always resolves to the same content.

## Teams

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "centralcity.agent/v1",
  "kind": "Team",
  "metadata": { "name": "research-team", "displayName": "Research team" },
  "spec": {
    "coordinator": "requester",
    "members": [
      {
        "name": "requester",
        "manifest": {
          "apiVersion": "centralcity.agent/v1",
          "kind": "Agent",
          "metadata": { "name": "requester" },
          "spec": {
            "capabilities": ["research"],
            "runtime": { "mode": "external" },
            "policy": { "maxChildren": 1, "maxDepth": 2 }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "researcher",
        "manifest": {
          "apiVersion": "centralcity.agent/v1",
          "kind": "Agent",
          "metadata": { "name": "researcher" },
          "spec": { "extends": "template:research-analyst@1.0.0", "policy": { "maxChildren": 1 } }
        }
      },
      { "name": "checker", "ref": "template:fact-checker@1.0.0" }
    ],
    "connections": [
      { "from": "requester", "to": "researcher" },
      { "from": "researcher", "to": "checker" }
    ],
    "policy": { "budgetUsd": 0, "maxDepth": 2 }
  }
}
```

This is the built-in `template:research-team@1.0.0`: the whole team from one prompt. A member has exactly one of an inline `manifest` (whose `metadata.name` must equal the member name) or a `ref`, which is shorthand for `{metadata: {name}, spec: {extends: ref}}`. Connections are directional (`from` may send work to `to`). Team `policy.budgetUsd` (default 0) caps the sum of member budgets; `policy.maxDepth` (≤3, default 3) caps the chain length from the coordinator.

## Plan and apply

Planning is pure and deterministic (same input and context → identical plan, in member and connection order). The plan lists each agent as `create`, `update` (with `previousHash` and depth-2 `changes` when the old manifest is supplied) or `noop`, each connection as `create` or `noop`, and reports:

- `errors` — `ok` is false if any exist and apply must refuse. Codes include the schema codes (`UNKNOWN_KEY`, `TOO_LARGE`, `URL_NOT_ALLOWED`, `DUPLICATE_NAME`, …), resolution codes (`TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND`, `POLICY_LOOSENED`, …), `COORDINATOR_MISSING`, `UNKNOWN_MEMBER`, `SELF_CONNECTION`, `DUPLICATE_CONNECTION`, `CONNECTION_CYCLE` (with the cycle path), `DEPTH_EXCEEDED`, `CHILDREN_EXCEEDED`, `TEAM_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`, `CAPABILITY_UNSUPPORTED`, `NAME_CONFLICT` (a hand-made agent already uses the name) and `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` (workspace limits or remaining quota). Paths point into the submitted document, for example `spec.members[1].manifest.spec.policy.budgetUsd` or `spec.members[2].ref`.
- `warnings` — `UNREACHABLE_MEMBER`, `RUNTIME_PENDING`, `AMBIGUOUS_EXISTING`.
- `approvals` / `requiresApproval` — zero-cost is the default. Any created or updated agent with `budgetUsd > 0` (`BUDGET_NONZERO`) or a paid model provider `anthropic`, `openai` or `byo` (`PAID_MODEL`), and a non-zero team budget when anything changes, requires explicit owner approval before apply.
- `quota` and `summary` counts, and `team.teamHash` (hash over team metadata, coordinator, policy, connections and member hashes).

**Idempotency.** Apply records each agent's `manifestHash` under its manifest `name`. Planning the same team again then yields only no-ops and needs no approval. Revoked agents are ignored and can be re-created.

## Apply

`city_apply_team` (and manifest-mode `city_create_agent`, which applies a one-member plan without connections) runs in one transaction holding the workspace row lock:

1. **Idempotency receipt.** The `idempotency_key` is looked up per grant (per source bucket for anonymous calls). The same key with the same arguments returns the originally applied agents and connections, described from their current state; the same key with different arguments is a `conflict`. In unclaimed mode a replay never issues a claim token or enrollment codes again (`secrets_already_issued: true`), and keys must be unguessable (UUID v4 or 128-bit base64url). A new key simply re-plans, which yields no-ops for unchanged members.
2. **Re-plan under the lock** against the current workspace: manifest agents by name and hash, current connections, the workspace limits and the remaining capacity (`quotas.remaining`), forks loaded from stored manifest revisions (own revisions, or other owners' `public` ones only).
3. **Autonomy checks** added to the plan's `errors`: `OWNER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` (owned) or `UNCLAIMED_ZERO_COST_ONLY` (anonymous) for anything that would need spend approval, `RUNTIME_NOT_APPLICABLE` for `a2a` runtimes, `RUNTIME_MODE_CHANGE` when an update would switch hosted/external, `PARENT_NOT_FOUND` / `PARENT_NOT_ALLOWED` and `LINEAGE_TOO_DEEP` (lineage depth at most 4). A plan with connections to create warns `SCOPE_REQUIRED` without `connections:create`; apply then refuses with `forbidden`. Any error refuses the apply (`forbidden` for approval, `conflict` for pure quota, otherwise `invalid_arguments`) with the issues attached.
4. **`expected_team_hash`**, when given, must equal the re-planned `team_hash` (`TEAM_HASH_MISMATCH`, `conflict`), so an AI can review a plan and apply exactly that plan.
5. **Write.** Each created agent records its manifest name, manifest hash, `revision: 1`, creator, parent agent, depth and root sponsor; an update bumps the revision and rewrites name, description and capability. Every creation or update stores the full resolved manifest as a new revision. Connections are created between the new agent ids.

**Lineage.** The coordinator is placed under `parent_agent_id` (or is a root with depth 0). Every member reachable from the coordinator gets the member that first connects to it (breadth-first, member order) as its parent; unreachable members share the coordinator's parent. `rootSponsor` is the owner (or `unclaimed:<source>` until claimed). Revoking an agent, by the owner or with `city_control`, revokes every descendant.

**Runtime.** `hosted` members become zero-cost deterministic demos; `external` members become runtime records and the response carries a single-use `enrollment_code` for each one that has no credential yet (the runtime exchanges it at `POST /api/runtime/enroll` for its credential; see [ASSISTANT_CONNECTION.md](ASSISTANT_CONNECTION.md)). The agent's native capability is its first manifest capability.

**Unclaimed mode.** Anonymous applies never match existing agents: each call creates new agents in the caller's source partition and returns a claim token. Anonymous calls use `https://centralcity.ai/mcp/open`.

## Agent Cards and signing

The card follows the pinned A2A 1.0 `AgentCard` message (commit `1736957…`, see [A2A_TRANSPORT.md](A2A_TRANSPORT.md)): `supportedInterfaces: [{url: "<baseUrl>/api/runtime/a2a/<agentId>", protocolBinding: "JSONRPC", protocolVersion: "1.0"}]` (the live message endpoint; `/a2a/<agentId>` is reserved as a future alias and today serves only `/a2a/<agentId>/.well-known/agent-card.json`), `capabilities {streaming: false, pushNotifications: false, extensions: [urn:central-city:a2a:native-auth:1, required]}`, `securitySchemes.centralCityNative.httpAuthSecurityScheme {scheme: "Bearer"}` with a matching `securityRequirements` entry, default modes `text/plain` in and `application/json` out, and skills from the manifest (or one per capability). `version` defaults to `m-<first 12 hex of manifestHash>`. `baseUrl` must be https, except http on loopback for development.

Signatures use JWS (RFC 7515) with Ed25519 (`alg: EdDSA`, RFC 8037) via `node:crypto`. The protected header is `{alg, kid, typ: "JOSE"}` (plus optional `jku`). The payload is the JCS form of the card without `signatures` and is detached, so each entry is `{protected, signature}` and `detachedCompact()` gives `<protected>..<signature>`. The default `kid` is the RFC 7638 JWK thumbprint. Verification recomputes the canonical payload, rejects any `alg` other than EdDSA, `crit`/`b64` headers, and unknown `kid`s, and is valid when at least one signature verifies.

**Rotation.** Sign with the new key while keeping the old signature (signing appends a signature and replaces only one with the same `kid`), publish both public keys in the JWKS, then drop the old key from the JWKS once cached cards expire. Private keys serialize as Ed25519 JWKs and must be stored encrypted like other platform secrets; they must never be committed.

**Serving.** Cards are compiled from the current manifest revision and signed per request with the platform key; the public keys are published at `https://centralcity.ai/.well-known/jwks.json`.

## Open items

- An owner approval step for plans that need spend approval; until then AI clients may only apply zero-cost manifests.
- Outbound `a2a` runtimes and the `/a2a/<agentId>` message alias.
- Per-agent `maxChildren`/`maxDepth` are checked against team connections at plan time, and lineage depth is capped at apply; runtime delegation enforcement is future work.
